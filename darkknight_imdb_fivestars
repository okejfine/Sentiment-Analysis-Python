Watch the IMAX version if you can

I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan "Biggest
screen in the UK"), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an
IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot
for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb
acting.

The movie could also have been called "The Joker", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance,
this still is a Batman movie. And "The Dark Knight" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title.
I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with
the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him
even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why
that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote.
This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!
